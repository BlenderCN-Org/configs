<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="7">As I went through last month&rsquo;s decluttering challenge, I realized I had a bunch of books I want to read, but that I don&rsquo;t actually set aside time to read them.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="8">A lot of aspirational clutter is like that: we have outdoor equipment, things for hobbies, clutter from different projects we hope to do, things for gardening and cooking and photography &hellip; but we don&rsquo;t actually create the time to do these aspirations.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="9">What if we decided to set aside time each day for one of these aspirations?</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="10">This month, I challenge you to set aside time to read all the books on your reading list, or on your shelves. You don&rsquo;t have to read them all this month, but you do have to set aside time each day, so that eventually all (or most of) your books will get read.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="11"><strong class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="49">The challenge: set aside a certain number of minutes each morning (you choose how many), and actually read a book during that session.</strong></p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="12">For example:</p>
<ul class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="14"><li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="13">I decided to set aside 30 minutes every morning.</li>
<li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="15">I set a daily reminder to do that.</li>
<li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="16">When the reminder goes off, I actually clear away distractions and read for 30 minutes. (Note: I can still read more at other times during the day.)</li>
<li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="17">Each week, I report to others whether I did it or not.</li>
</ul><p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="18">If I stick to this challenge, I will have read for 15 hours (at least). That&rsquo;s probably enough for 4 books, for me. At the end of a year of doing this daily habit, I&rsquo;ll have read nearly 50 books. I know many people read more than that, but that would <em nodeIndex="50">completely clear off my reading list</em>. (I also know some books are 2-3x as long as the average book, but I&rsquo;m happy with getting 30-40 books read in a year.)</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="19">So are you up for the challenge?</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="20">Here&rsquo;s how you do it:</p>
<ol class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="22"><li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="21">Commit to the challenge (<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/readingeveryday" nodeIndex="51">#readingeveryday on Twitter</a>, or wherever you&rsquo;d like to publicly commit).</li>
<li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="23">Pick a number of minutes you want to read. If you don&rsquo;t read right now, pick 15-20 minutes. If you read a lot, pick 45-60 minutes.</li>
<li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="24">Pick a time to do it in the morning (preferably). Set a reminder for that time.</li>
<li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="25">When the reminder goes off, clear everything away and read without distractions, without switching to something else, just reading. (It helps to let others nearby to know you&rsquo;re in &ldquo;non-interruptable reading time&rdquo; if you can.)</li>
<li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="26">Report to someone each week, sharing your successes, obstacles, adjustments for the coming week. You can report on Twitter or Facebook with the&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/readingeveryday" nodeIndex="52">#readingeveryday</a>&nbsp;hashtag, or <a href="https://seachange.zenhabits.net/" nodeIndex="53">join my Sea Change Program</a> to do the challenge with me.</li>
</ol><p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="27">Also pick what books you want to read this month (2-5 books)!</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="28">What would it change for you if you did this?</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="29">If you&rsquo;re not willing to set aside this time, can you let go of all or most of the books on your reading list?</p>
