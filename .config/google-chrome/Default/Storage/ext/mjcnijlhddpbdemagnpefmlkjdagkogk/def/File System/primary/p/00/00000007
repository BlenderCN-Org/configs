<p nodeIndex="67">Michael Ellsberg has been a good friend since 2000.&nbsp;</p>
<p nodeIndex="68">In the last few years, he has made a study of self-study. How do the best in business do what they do? Using his findings, he has:</p>
<p nodeIndex="69">&ndash; Overcome a debilitating case of bipolar II (<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelellsberg/2011/07/18/how-i-overcame-bipolar-ii/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2127">here&rsquo;s how</a>). <br nodeIndex="2128">
&ndash; Landed one of the most powerful literary agents in the world. <br nodeIndex="2129">
&ndash; Published not one but two books from major New York publishers, the second scoring a 6-figure advance. <br nodeIndex="2130">
&ndash; Found the woman of his dreams and married her. <br nodeIndex="2131">
&ndash; Built a well-followed blog on Forbes.com with zero prior blogging experience.</p>
<p nodeIndex="70">Most recently, Michael has interviewed the likes of fashion magnate Russell Simmons, Facebook cofounder Dustin Moskovitz, Facebook founding president Sean Parker, WordPress lead developer Matt Mullenweg, and Pink Floyd songwriter and lead guitarist David Gilmour. Dozens of iconic figures pepper his list of case subjects.</p>
<p nodeIndex="71">Why? Because none of them graduated from college, and he wanted to learn how they educated themselves. His findings were then encapsulated in &ldquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591844207/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=offsitoftimfe-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1591844207" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2132">The Education of Millionaires</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p nodeIndex="72">In this post, Michael will discuss how uber-successful people leapfrog their peers without any formal credentials.&nbsp;By the end of this post, you&rsquo;ll have a roadmap for hacking &ldquo;job requirements,&rdquo; degrees, and the lot&hellip;<span id="more-6103" nodeIndex="2133"></span></p>
<p nodeIndex="73">In the words of Alfonso Bedoya in&nbsp;<em nodeIndex="2134">The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</em>:</p>
<p nodeIndex="74">&ldquo;Badges? We ain&rsquo;t got no badges. We don&rsquo;t need no badges! I don&rsquo;t have to show you any <em nodeIndex="2135">stinkin&rsquo; badges!&rdquo;</em></p>

<h3 nodeIndex="76">Enter Michael Ellsberg</h3>
<p nodeIndex="77">A phrase you&rsquo;ll see a lot if you search for a job these days is &ldquo;BA required, MA preferred.&rdquo; A recent <em nodeIndex="2136">New York Times</em> article was entitled &ldquo;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/education/edlife/edl-24masters-t.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2137">The Master&rsquo;s as the New Bachelor&rsquo;s</a>,&rdquo; and ended with the following question:</p>
<p nodeIndex="78"><em nodeIndex="2138">Given how many people are now getting master&rsquo;s to stand out from those with bachelor&rsquo;s, <strong nodeIndex="2139">&ldquo;Will the Ph.D. become the new master&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</strong></em></p>
<p nodeIndex="79">This anxiety around educational credentials has launched a million self-criticisms across the nation&hellip;</p>
<p nodeIndex="80">&ldquo;Well, if I don&rsquo;t have my BA, I better not even think about getting that &lsquo;BA required&rsquo; job!&rdquo;&nbsp;Or, for those who have a BA: &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s just like having a high school diploma these days. I better go back to school so I can spend two years and another fifty-to-hundred grand getting an MA. That way, I can stand out from all those BAs and compete with the MAs on an <em nodeIndex="2140">even playing field</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p nodeIndex="81">The purpose of this article is to even the playing field for you, without the BA, MA, or MBA, and without the student debt. You can get those degrees for other reasons (if you feel they will enrich your life, for instance). But never again should you feel that they&rsquo;ll give you a massive advantage in job searches or economic opportunity. For your typical job search, those advantages are massively overhyped. They can be sidestepped, outsmarted, and overcome.<a class="sup" name="citation1" href="https://tim.blog/2011/09/29/8-steps-to-getting-what-you-want-without-formal-credentials/#footnotes" nodeIndex="2141"><span nodeIndex="2142">1</span></a></p>
<h3 nodeIndex="82">Forget the Formal Job Market&mdash;Focus on the Informal Job Market</h3>
<p nodeIndex="83">At age 25, Eben Pagan had a resume that consisted of dropping out of community college after one semester, touring in a Christian rock band, and various stints at manual labor.&nbsp;Most people would say this resume qualified Eben for a life of asking &ldquo;Would you like fries with that?&rdquo;</p>
<p nodeIndex="84">Thinking that he might get into real estate, Eben signed up for a course by a real estate marketing and sales trainer named Joe Stumpf.</p>
<blockquote nodeIndex="85">
<p nodeIndex="86">&ldquo;I immediately recognized I had to somehow work for this guy and soak up his knowledge. But I didn&rsquo;t know how I was going to do that. Here he was, leading big group workshops all over the country, and I was barely scraping by.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p nodeIndex="87">Most likely, had Stumpf&rsquo;s organization been advertising open positions (which it wasn&rsquo;t), those positions would have had all kinds of job requirements attached to them. Eben, with his lackluster resume, wouldn&rsquo;t have made the cut.</p>
<p nodeIndex="88">This, however, is where Eben began &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; the concept of job requirements and credentials.</p>
<blockquote nodeIndex="89">
<p nodeIndex="90">&ldquo;I started calling up his outbound telemarketers. These guys are trying to sell you on something, so they&rsquo;ll talk to anyone! I told them about my experience at the workshop and became friendly with them. I found out they were all fans of Tony Robbins. Once, I found this set of Tony Robbins tapes at Goodwill for ten bucks, so I packed the tapes up and sent them to them. Things like that.</p>
<p nodeIndex="91">&ldquo;One day, they sent me some audiotapes of Joe. I called them up and said, &lsquo;The audio on this program is not good.&rsquo; I had a background in sound from my band days. So I talked to the general manager of the company, and I went to work for them, first doing audiovisual for their live seminars. I worked there for three years, rising up the ranks.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p nodeIndex="92">The skills Eben learned in those three years, studying from a world-class master of marketing and sales, set him up for the massive business success he&rsquo;s had in the rest of his career. Shortly after, Eben began selling info-products (mainly e-books, membership communities, Web-based trainings, and in-person weekend workshops) on the Internet. Today,&nbsp;Eben&rsquo;s company, Hot Topic Media, now brings in around $30 million a year in revenue and employs about 70 people around the globe. He founded it himself, and grew it over a decade with no investors. He is a self-made multimillionaire, and would never have to work another day in his life if he didn&rsquo;t want to. He runs his business off his MacBook, and spends his time either working from his home office in New York (which has a majestic view of the Empire State Building), or his beach-side home office in Miami.</p>
<p nodeIndex="93">The story of how Eben got this all-important first job demonstrates a distinction that will be crucial for you in seeking opportunities throughout your life, no matter the status of your formal credentials.</p>
<p nodeIndex="94"><strong nodeIndex="2143">It&rsquo;s the distinction between the <em nodeIndex="2144">formal</em> job market and the <em nodeIndex="2145">informal</em> job market.</strong></p>
<p nodeIndex="95">The informal job market comprises all jobs that are <em nodeIndex="2146">not</em> filled through someone responding to a job advertisement. Usually, these are jobs that are filled through <em nodeIndex="2147">relationships</em>. Either there is a position at the firm that needs to be filled, and an employee at the firm knows someone who&rsquo;s qualified. Or, the firm wants to bring a specific person they know to join the team, and they create a position for that person out of thin air.</p>
<p nodeIndex="96">If you do some Googling on the informal job market, you&rsquo;ll learn something shocking: according to various estimates (on <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2009/06/09/news/economy/hidden_jobs/" nodeIndex="2148">CNN</a>, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/12/20/earlyshow/living/money/main7167784.shtml" nodeIndex="2149">CBS</a>, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23694320/ns/business-personal_finance/t/teens-face-tough-market-summer-jobs/" nodeIndex="2150">MSNBC</a>, and <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/02/08/133474431/a-successful-job-search-its-all-about-networking" nodeIndex="2151">NPR</a>) somewhere around 80% of jobs get filled informally. In other words, only 20% of jobs get filled through people responding to job ads (the primary method of job seeking most people do).<a class="sup" name="citation2" href="https://tim.blog/2011/09/29/8-steps-to-getting-what-you-want-without-formal-credentials/#footnotes" nodeIndex="2152"><span nodeIndex="2153">2</span></a></p>
<p nodeIndex="97">So, how does the 80% of hiring that occurs in the informal job market actually happen? The way Eben did it: by building up a professional relationship with people within the organization doing the hiring, long before the hire is made.</p>
<p nodeIndex="98">Connections. Referrals. <em nodeIndex="2154">Knowing people who know people.</em></p>
<p nodeIndex="99">This means that, in the vastly larger informal job market, human relationships and a solid network are far more important than GPA figures on a resume.</p>
<p nodeIndex="100">Yet, nearly all the educational and career advice you&rsquo;ll get (focused on making your resume perfect for recruiters) optimizes you for competing on the much smaller and tougher <em nodeIndex="2155">formal</em> segment of the job market, rather than on the <em nodeIndex="2156">informal</em> job market. Seems a bit ridiculous, given that the informal job market is much larger and easier to &ldquo;hack&rdquo; into.</p>
<h3 nodeIndex="101">Employers Require <em nodeIndex="2157">Skills</em>, Not Degrees</h3>
<p nodeIndex="102">What&rsquo;s the relevance of the course content for a BA or MA program to a typical corporate job? In most cases, absolutely zippo. What employers actually mean when they say, &ldquo;BA required, MA preferred,&rdquo; is that they want prospects with a certain set of skills, character traits, and attitudes. Specifically, they&rsquo;re looking for organizational skills, the ability to follow instructions and make deadlines, critical thinking skills, writing and communication skills, research skills, and so forth. Plus, they want applicants with the general maturity, stability, perseverance, respect for authority, and work ethic required to get through a multi-year academic program.</p>
<p nodeIndex="103">In the formal job market, there&rsquo;s no easy way for employers to rapidly assess all of those traits without some kind of objective screening tool. <em nodeIndex="2158">Educational attainment</em> has become that screening tool.</p>
<p nodeIndex="104">So let&rsquo;s get clear about one thing. Saying that a BA and MA is &ldquo;required&rdquo; to do a certain job is BS. These degrees are not actually <em nodeIndex="2159">required</em> to do the job well. Rather, they serve as convenient screening tools for recruiters needing to wade through piles of cold resumes on the formal job market. That&rsquo;s it, nothing more.</p>
<p nodeIndex="105"><strong nodeIndex="2160">Your entire multi-year, six-figure education is reduced to a simple check-mark used to get past impatient screeners on the other end of a Craigslist ad.</strong></p>
<p nodeIndex="106">For a person seeking a job or economic opportunity, this whole system of job screening is wildly inefficient.</p>
<p nodeIndex="107">What if instead, you focused on the <em nodeIndex="2161">informal</em> job market, which is vastly larger and more accessible (especially if you learn some basic networking skills)?</p>
<p nodeIndex="108">The screening process in the informal job market does not happen through cookie-cutter grades, degrees, scores, numbers, or letters. It doesn&rsquo;t happen through educational checkboxes and punchcards.</p>
<p nodeIndex="109">Rather, the screening process is embedded within human relationships: whom do you know, and who knows you? It happens through the layers of trust, credibility, and reputation that occur naturally within flesh-and-blood, offline social networks.<a class="sup" name="citation3" href="https://tim.blog/2011/09/29/8-steps-to-getting-what-you-want-without-formal-credentials/#footnotes" nodeIndex="2162"><span nodeIndex="2163">3</span></a></p>
<p nodeIndex="110">Thus, in seeking opportunity within the informal job market, your networking, connecting, and relationship-forging skills are far more important than your academic test-taking skills. (I&rsquo;ll be giving you some specific pointers on how to begin learning these real world skills in a moment.)</p>
<p nodeIndex="111">Formal credentials are not irrelevant in the unadvertised job market. All else equal, it&rsquo;s still better to have more educational attainment than less. But that &ldquo;all else equal&rdquo; is the kicker, because within that is buried the &ldquo;else&rdquo; that actually matters in the informal job market: social-based credibility, referrals, your online and offline reputation, and your portfolio of demonstrable results achieved in the past.</p>
<p nodeIndex="112">Thus, the informal job market allows for many creative ways to hack &ldquo;job requirements,&rdquo; by simply developing relationships with the employers, as Eben did. People like to give economic opportunities to people they know and trust. Requirements be damned.</p>
<h3 nodeIndex="113">Create Your Own Damn Credentials; Create Your Own Damn Job</h3>
<p nodeIndex="114">Most people wouldn&rsquo;t dream of opening a designer wellness center, charging $500 per hour to coach VIP corporate clients on weight loss, if they didn&rsquo;t already have some <em nodeIndex="2164">serious</em> credentials to their name (at least a registered dietician, if not an MD or a Ph.D. in nutrition).</p>
<p nodeIndex="115">Unless you&rsquo;re my wife, <a href="http://www.pleasurableweightloss.com/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2165">Jena la Flamme</a>. Then you do it without even having an undergraduate degree.</p>
<p nodeIndex="116">Jena dropped out of college her junior year to travel around India for two years using the $6,000 she earned teaching English in Martinique. (You can get a great real-world education traveling around India on $3,000 a year, which is far cheaper than most colleges.)</p>
<p nodeIndex="117">She had struggled with overeating and binge eating throughout her teens, and was perpetually trying to lose twenty pounds. Through self-education in eating and nutrition, she was finally able to end her struggle with food, and lost the weight. She started coaching other women on how to do this, initially charging $100 an hour for her coaching sessions.</p>
<p nodeIndex="118">Reading <em nodeIndex="2166"><a href="http://amzn.to/oyzecf" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2167">The 4-Hour Workweek</a></em>&nbsp;inspired Jena to build up an outsourced backend office in India, which allowed her to handle a higher volume of business and ramp up her coaching to the masses, offering one-to-many Internet-based classes. She began studying marketing and sales (learning much of it from college dropout Eben Pagan), and her business exploded.</p>
<p nodeIndex="119">Soon, Jena&rsquo;s time became so scarce as her business grew that, if clients wanted access to her training, they started having to pay more and more for it &mdash; $200/hour, then $250, then $300 and up. Today, she charges more than a lot of lawyers and Ph.D. psychologists make per hour.</p>
<p nodeIndex="120">Her credentials? A large following online, free content in her blog and newsletter, a great set of real-world testimonials, her public image and reputation through great marketing, and her personal story.</p>
<p nodeIndex="121">Jena hacked her professional credentials.</p>
<p nodeIndex="122">By the end of this post, you&rsquo;ll know how to do this for yourself.</p>
<h3 nodeIndex="123">Common Objections to Hacking Job Requirements, and&nbsp;The Yellow Pages Portfolio Fallacy</h3>
<p nodeIndex="124"><strong nodeIndex="2168"><em nodeIndex="2169">&ldquo;But the higher the degree you have, the more you earn, on average!&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p nodeIndex="125">Yes, it is undeniable. The&nbsp;<a href="http://trends.collegeboard.org/education_pays" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2170">College Board reported</a>&nbsp;the median income for various degrees back in 2010. This is what they found:</p>
<p nodeIndex="126">&ndash; High school diploma = $33,800 <br nodeIndex="2171">
&ndash; BA degree = $55,700 (65% higher than those with a high school diploma) <br nodeIndex="2172">
&ndash; MA degree = $67,300 (21% higher than those with a BA) <br nodeIndex="2173">
&ndash; Ph.D. = $91,900 (36.5% higher than those with an MA)</p>
<p nodeIndex="127">Yet these statistics suffer from a rather serious problem. I call it the Yellow Pages Portfolio fallacy.</p>
<p nodeIndex="128">Imagine investing $1 million in the following manner: You are to call up companies in the Yellow Pages, in alphabetical order, and see if they&rsquo;ll take $100,000 for a 10% stake in their company. The first ten companies that say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; will complete your investment.</p>
<p nodeIndex="129">That&rsquo;s your $1 million portfolio.</p>
<p nodeIndex="130">Now, compare the financial future of two people who have an identical overall investment portfolio (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.), except that one person <em nodeIndex="2174">also</em> has this extra $1 million Yellow Pages Portfolio on top of all their other investments. Who earns higher returns from their overall profile of investments?</p>
<p nodeIndex="131">All else equal, the person with the Yellow Pages Portfolio.</p>
<p nodeIndex="132"><em nodeIndex="2175">Therefore you should invest $1 million in the Yellow Pages Portfolio, as well</em>.</p>
<p nodeIndex="133">Uh, actually, no. That is the Yellow Pages Portfolio Fallacy in action.</p>
<p nodeIndex="134">All the example above suggests is that having an additional $1 million in net capital (no matter how moronically it is invested) is financially superior to having $1 million <em nodeIndex="2176">less</em> in net capital.</p>
<p nodeIndex="135">The example says nothing about <em nodeIndex="2177">the best way</em> for you to invest $1 million!</p>
<p nodeIndex="136">The above College Board statistics, which are the basis for nearly all public arguments about the financial advantages of higher education, are riddled with the Yellow Pages Portfolio Fallacy through and through.</p>
<p nodeIndex="137">All they show is that, on average, people who have invested more in their learning earn more. Big whoop. They will never answer the more important question: <em nodeIndex="2178">Is spending your time and money on formal credentials the best way of investing in your continued learning?</em></p>
<p nodeIndex="138">I&rsquo;m not sure of a way to test that latter question with anything close to scientific rigor. However, we&rsquo;ve seen that formal credentials have a much higher salience in the <em nodeIndex="2179">formal</em> job market (which is the smallest part of the job market). Cheaper and more informal modes of career development, such as learning to become a great networker (&agrave; la Eben Pagan) have a higher bang for your buck in the <em nodeIndex="2180">informal</em> job market, which is vastly larger.</p>
<p nodeIndex="139">So, my own unscientific guess is that, outside of fields which legally require credentials for licensure, there are far more efficient ways to go about investing in your earning power, rather than increasing your formal credentials. Just as there are far better ways of investing $1 million than in the Yellow Pages Portfolio.</p>
<p nodeIndex="140"><strong nodeIndex="2181"><em nodeIndex="2182">&ldquo;But degrees are an advantage in a tough market.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p nodeIndex="141">Yes, and it would be an advantage for heightening my wife&rsquo;s attraction to me if I showed up for our next date night in a custom $100,000 <a href="http://www.alexanderamosu.co.uk/en/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2183">Alexander Amosu suit</a>.</p>
<p nodeIndex="142">Talking about an advantage in absolute terms, without comparing it to the costs and benefits of&nbsp;<em nodeIndex="2184">other options</em>&nbsp;(i.e. opportunity cost), is pointless.</p>
<p nodeIndex="143">To extend the analogy:&nbsp;<em nodeIndex="2185">Given the resources now available to me, are there ways I could go about increasing and maintaining my wife&rsquo;s attraction to me which would be more effective, per dollar spent, than buying a $100,000 suit?</em></p>
<p nodeIndex="144">Using the 80/20 principle, I can think of a few things that would go 80% of the way towards increasing her attraction for me, without having to spend a lot of money. Perhaps a thoughtful handwritten poem, a home-cooked meal, a massage afterwards (or even something learned from, um,&nbsp;<em nodeIndex="2186">that section</em>, in The 4-Hour Body). I could live without that last 20% of extra attraction the Amosu suit would get me (hot as it is), and save the hundred grand for other things, like a home for us.</p>
<p nodeIndex="145">There&rsquo;s no question that increased formal credentials can give you an advantage. The question is, is it the best advantage you can buy with the amount of money and time you&rsquo;re going to spend?</p>
<p nodeIndex="146">A master&rsquo;s, for example, can cost two years, up to $100,000 in tuition (hmm, similar in price to that custom Amosu suit), and another $50,000-$100,000 in foregone earnings. Sure, that will give you an advantage. But the primary advantage it gives you is in slipping past screeners in the formal job market, where there are such things as &ldquo;job requirements.&rdquo; If you get creative in the&nbsp;<em nodeIndex="2187">informal&nbsp;</em>job market (and outside of legally licensed fields like law and medicine), the notion of &ldquo;job requirements&rdquo; is&mdash;as we&rsquo;ve seen&mdash;negotiable. Thus, the advantage a master&rsquo;s gives you is far less salient.</p>
<p nodeIndex="147">I could think of a lot of ways you could spend $100,000 and two years that would give you a better advantage in the informal<em nodeIndex="2188">&nbsp;</em>job market, over having a masters degree or even a bachelor&rsquo;s. In fact, I&rsquo;m going to outline an example of how I think you could spend a fraction of that $100K and get far superior results in just a moment.</p>
<h3 nodeIndex="148">&ldquo;So&hellip; what should I do?&rdquo;</h3>
<p nodeIndex="149">There is no good data (and I don&rsquo;t think there ever will be) on what the best way to invest in your own learning would be. There is only data showing that <em nodeIndex="2189">more</em> investment in your learning is better than less. (Duh!)</p>
<p nodeIndex="150">In the absence of any data suggesting what the <em nodeIndex="2190">best</em> investment in learning is, you will need to rely on your gut.</p>
<p nodeIndex="151">If your gut tells you that investing in your own continued learning informally would be the most effective for you, then don&rsquo;t let the salesmen of formal credentials scare you out of it. The other option, of course, is to spend years of your life in an undergraduate or graduate program, dropping major cash on tuition, incurring foregone earnings, and going into massive debt in order to rack up ever-more formal credentials, so you can &ldquo;compete&rdquo; with millions of others getting the exact same credential each year.</p>
<p nodeIndex="152">If you instead decide to make more informal investments in your learning for success, over your whole life and career, <a href="http://amzn.to/pJ3WbK" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2191">my book</a> is designed to point you on the path to getting started.</p>
<p nodeIndex="153">In the spirit of blogging, however, I&rsquo;d like to give you a robust outline of how to go about investing in your own success in the informal job markets. This content is original to this post, and is not even in my book.</p>
<p nodeIndex="154">As I present this outline, I will assume that you are currently unemployed, and that you&rsquo;re willing to devote full-time effort into finding employment or creating a practice or business. In other words, you&rsquo;re willing to invest all the time you&rsquo;d otherwise spend surfing Craigslist jobs sections, sending out resumes and cover letters (and hearing crickets), to hacking job credentials instead.</p>
<p nodeIndex="155">I did not follow the path below exactly&mdash;my path was much more random and meandering, and took about 10 years through trial and error. Instead, I&rsquo;ve tried to distill what I&rsquo;ve learned from this decade into something clear and simple that could be followed by a focused, determined person, in one year. If I were to do it over again, this is how I&rsquo;d do it.</p>
<p nodeIndex="156"><strong nodeIndex="2192">Without further ado, here are my 9 steps to conquering the informal job market within one year (at a fraction of the cost of a Master&rsquo;s degree.)</strong></p>
<h3 nodeIndex="157">Step 1: Choose Your New Field of Learning</h3>
<p nodeIndex="158"><em nodeIndex="2193"><strong nodeIndex="2194">Timeline: Month 1 (Starting out)</strong></em></p>
<p nodeIndex="159">Figure out a field you&rsquo;d like to build a career in. You don&rsquo;t need to have great (or any) formal credentials. As I said earlier, the more creative and less regulated a field is, the more amenable it is to this kind of job credential-hacking. It&rsquo;s easier to hack job credentials in programming, design, writing, sales, photography, multimedia, the arts, and entrepreneurialism, or in general &ldquo;I need a job, any job!&rdquo; type situations, than in accounting, law, or medicine.</p>
<p nodeIndex="160">So before proceeding to the next step, you&rsquo;ll need to choose a field whose formal job credentials you&rsquo;d like to hack. My field of choice was commercial writing.</p>
<blockquote nodeIndex="161">
<p nodeIndex="162"><strong>Cost:</strong> $0</p>
<p nodeIndex="163"><strong>Time:</strong> An epiphany in the shower; a long walk on a beach; a few hours surfing Google.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 nodeIndex="164">Step 2: Showcase Your Learning</h3>
<p nodeIndex="165"><strong nodeIndex="2195"><em nodeIndex="2196">Timeline: Months 1-2</em></strong></p>
<p nodeIndex="166">In this step, you will start a simple blog detailing your journey to learn everything there is to learn in this field.</p>
<p nodeIndex="167">But first, you&rsquo;ll need to kickstart the learning process: Read one professional, business, or how-to book related to your chosen field per week. Choose a mix of classics in the field, along with some off-the-beaten-path books you discover through your reading and research. These books are typically written by active practitioners in your field; they are not the abstract books written by theorists, which tend to get assigned in academic programs. Thus, these books (written by actual, successful practitioners) will be infinitely more valuable in terms of streetwise content.</p>
<p nodeIndex="168">Then write one blog post each week detailing exactly what you learned from that week&rsquo;s book.</p>
<p nodeIndex="169">This kills at least ten birds with one stone:</p>
<ol nodeIndex="171"><li nodeIndex="170">You get the education of reading practical books related to your field.</li>
<li nodeIndex="172">You demonstrate to potential clients/employers that you understand content related to your chosen field.</li>
<li nodeIndex="173">You demonstrate your willingness and curiosity to continue upgrading your knowledge in your chosen field.</li>
<li nodeIndex="174">You demonstrate your researching ability.</li>
<li nodeIndex="175">You demonstrate your writing ability.</li>
<li nodeIndex="176">You demonstrate your critical thinking ability.</li>
<li nodeIndex="177">You demonstrate your creativity.</li>

<h3 nodeIndex="184">Step 3: Learn the Basics of Good Networking</h3>
<p nodeIndex="185"><strong nodeIndex="2202"><em nodeIndex="2203">Timeline: Still Months 1-2</em></strong></p>
<p nodeIndex="186">Being a good networker is not an optional skill if you want to succeed in the informal job market. It is <em nodeIndex="2204">the</em> skill. You&rsquo;ll also need to be good at your craft and good at sales (we&rsquo;ll work on those in a moment). But without a firm base of networking, you&rsquo;ll get nowhere.</p>
<p nodeIndex="187">Here is a 1-hour lecture I gave on <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelellsberg/2011/08/31/how-to-network-your-way-to-world-class-mentors-the-thiel-fellowship-lecture-part-1/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2205">how to become a world-class networker</a>. It&rsquo;s the best breakdown of good networking I know of, and it includes two live demos of networking skills in action.</p>
<!--VIDEO_1-->
<p nodeIndex="189">I delivered that presentation to the inaugural class of Thiel Fellows: 24 people under 20 years old, whom Peter Thiel is paying $100,000 each to &ldquo;stop out&rdquo; of college for two years and build businesses. Since they&rsquo;re not getting traditional formal credentials, these brilliant young people are going to need to learn how to get past the screeners of opportunity informally&mdash;which is what I taught them in this hour.</p>
<p nodeIndex="190">If you&rsquo;re more of a reader, here is a similar post on <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelellsberg/2011/05/16/3-steps-to-build-your-own-social-economy/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2206">how to become a great networker</a>. In my experience, the vast majority of people go about networking in exactly the wrong way. The video and article show you how to be one of the rare few who do it right.</p>
<p nodeIndex="191">Following the advice in the article, find three business owners per month you already know (either offline or online). Over the next two months, have conversations with them about what their challenges are, then do your damned best to start being of service to them. By the end of two months, you will have six new fans. And those are very good fans to have, because business owners know other business owners.</p>
<p nodeIndex="192">You&rsquo;ve started to build what I call a &ldquo;social economy&rdquo;&mdash;a circle of successful business owners whom you support, and who support you. Keep building this social economy as much as possible during the time you go through these steps. It will be your secret key to success in the informal job market.</p>

<p nodeIndex="197"><em nodeIndex="2207"><strong nodeIndex="2208">Timeline: Months 3-5</strong></em></p>
<p nodeIndex="198">Begin to seek opportunities where you can practice your skills. Offer small, light services related to your chosen field for free to people in your network.</p>
<p nodeIndex="199">If you&rsquo;re trying to hack credentials in design, offer free design services. If it&rsquo;s copywriting or advertising you&rsquo;re interested in, offer free copywriting or ad design to small businesses you patronize. (Small businesses rarely turn down free services!)</p>
<p nodeIndex="200">Say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m training to become [X], and I&rsquo;ve been meticulously studying the craft to learn how to do it well [link to your blog]. I&rsquo;d like to offer you [some free services around X] as I build my practice. I don&rsquo;t expect any payment at all. But down the road, if you like my work, perhaps you can refer me to other people you know who might benefit from it.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 nodeIndex="204">Step 5: Develop Case Studies of Your Work</h3>
<p nodeIndex="205"><em nodeIndex="2209"><strong nodeIndex="2210">Timeline: Still Months 3-5</strong></em></p>
<p nodeIndex="206">For 10 hours per week (when you are not networking or delivering services), blog about your experiences providing these services as case studies. Lessons learned, triumphs, mistakes, etc. Ask your client if you can use their name in the blog post, and show them what you&rsquo;ve written before it goes up (so you don&rsquo;t infringe on their privacy). Otherwise, hide and change all identifying details about the work.</p>

<h3 nodeIndex="210">Step 6: Develop Relationships With Mentors</h3>
<p nodeIndex="211"><strong nodeIndex="2211"><em nodeIndex="2212">Timeline: Still Months 3-5</em></strong></p>
<p nodeIndex="212">For the remaining 10 hours per week of this period, reach out to authors of the books you read and blogged about in Step 1, asking to interview them for your blog. The more time has passed since their last book came out, the more likely they&rsquo;ll be willing to do the interview, as authors are almost always thrilled when someone shows interest in past work.&nbsp;(However, if they&rsquo;re in the middle of writing or launching a new book, forget it! That&rsquo;s like asking a pregnant woman for help when she&rsquo;s about to go into labor.)</p>
<p nodeIndex="213">Now you are in the process of developing relationships with potential mentors in your field. This will pay off huge over the long run (for your career, personal development, and inner fulfillment).</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 nodeIndex="217">Step 7: Learn Sales</h3>
<p nodeIndex="218"><em nodeIndex="2213"><strong nodeIndex="2214">Timeline: Months 6-7</strong></em></p>
<p nodeIndex="219">Sorry, there&rsquo;s no way around this. If you don&rsquo;t learn sales, you will never reach the level of success you desire. Almost without exception, anyone who has achieved anything big in life was good at sales; if not literally selling products and services, then selling their ideas/vision.</p>
<p nodeIndex="220">Read <em nodeIndex="2215"><a href="http://amzn.to/okTGS8" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2216">SPIN Selling</a></em>&nbsp;by Neil Rackham. In my opinion, this is the best book on sales ever written. The focus is on deep inquiry into the customer&rsquo;s <em nodeIndex="2217">actual</em> problems, needs, dreams and desires &mdash; through asking the right questions and listening well &mdash; rather than through sleazy pitching. If you&rsquo;re only going to read one sales book in your life, that&rsquo;s the one you&rsquo;ll want to buy.</p>
<p nodeIndex="221">Once you feel you have a basic grasp of the concepts in the book, find someone in your social economy (see Step 2) who has some kind of business, whether it&rsquo;s products or services. The bigger the ticket price, the better, as there is a direct correlation between the ticket price of the sale, and the integrity, empathy, listening skills, and caring you have to have as a salesperson in order to sell it.</p>
<p nodeIndex="222">Ask if you can sell for them, with zero base salary. Perhaps you can get a commission, or perhaps not. But at this point, you&rsquo;re not doing it for immediate financial gains. You&rsquo;re doing it to get experience in sales, and to put what you learned from&nbsp;<em nodeIndex="2218">SPIN Selling</em> into practice. The reason you&rsquo;re doing it in an already-existing business (rather than your own) is that you want to get lots and lots of experience actually selling face-to-face with pre-qualified prospects, not trying to find people to sell to! My own freelance income nearly doubled when I learned proper, effective, non-sleazy, high-integrity sales.</p>
<blockquote nodeIndex="223">
<p nodeIndex="224"><strong nodeIndex="2219">Cost:</strong> $16 for <em nodeIndex="2220">SPIN Selling</em>. And you might actually <em nodeIndex="2221">make</em>&nbsp;money in sales commissions.</p>
<p nodeIndex="225"><strong nodeIndex="2222">Time:</strong> Devote 20 hours per week to a combination of studying the book and putting the techniques into practice in a friend or acquaintance&rsquo;s business; devote the other 20 hours per week during this period to continuing Step 3 and building your social economy.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 nodeIndex="226">Step 8: Sell and Deliver Your Services Within Your Social Economy</h3>
<p nodeIndex="227"><em nodeIndex="2223"><strong nodeIndex="2224">Timeline: Months 8-9</strong></em></p>
<p nodeIndex="228">You&rsquo;ve got the basics of your craft in place (credentials be damned!), you&rsquo;ve built up your social economy, and you&rsquo;ve learned sales.&nbsp;Everything is in place for you to start earning real money in your chosen field. Now you just have to go out and do it!</p>
<p nodeIndex="229">Have individual meetups with 10 business owners &mdash; the ones within your social economy &mdash; over breakfast, lunch, dinner, or drinks. Tell them about the portfolio of results you&rsquo;ve achieved in the last seven months, both online and offline. Have honest-to-goodness conversations about their needs (a high-integrity sales skill you learned during Step 7).</p>
<p nodeIndex="230">If they have a need you can address, use your SPIN Selling skills to get them excited about the idea of working with you. If they don&rsquo;t have a need you can address, connect them with someone else in your social economy who you think can help them. (This is Networking 101: refer people to the best solutions for their problems.)</p>
<p nodeIndex="231">Tell them about the specific type of problem and/or business owner you can help, and ask for their best three ideas for meeting that kind of business owner. You&rsquo;ll usually come away with several great ideas, and possibly even some referrals.</p>
<p nodeIndex="232">If you have been following the steps diligently, you&rsquo;d have to get worse than a 1/10 closing ratio to <em nodeIndex="2225">not</em> get a sale. If you can beat that (pathetically low) closing ratio, you&rsquo;ve got a sale.</p>
<p nodeIndex="233">Congratulations! You&rsquo;ve just hacked &ldquo;job requirements&rdquo; in the informal job market.</p>
<blockquote nodeIndex="234">
<p nodeIndex="235"><strong>Cost:</strong> $0.</p>
<p nodeIndex="236"><strong>Time:</strong> 40 hours per week spent networking, conducting sales meetings, and delivering services on the sales you close.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 nodeIndex="237">Step 9 (Optional): Rinse and Repeat</h3>
<p nodeIndex="238"><em nodeIndex="2226"><strong nodeIndex="2227">Timeline: Months 10 and beyond&hellip;</strong></em></p>
<p nodeIndex="239">If you continue to build on all the skills in Steps 1-8, you can carry on as a self-employed freelancer, working on your own schedule (often from a remote location), for the rest of your life. It&rsquo;s not a 4-hour workweek, but it definitely allows you to &ldquo;Escape 9-5&rdquo; and &ldquo;Live Anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p nodeIndex="240">This is the lifestyle I&rsquo;ve built up for myself over the last decade. As I mentioned, I took a much more meandering path than the steps above to get there, but if I was to do it all over again, that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d do it.</p>
<p nodeIndex="241">The steps I&rsquo;ve described above take about 9 months, the time of one academic year. The cost is around $300, mostly for books (less if you go to the library). The entire cost of this program is less than the cost of 2-3&nbsp;<em nodeIndex="2228">textbooks</em>&nbsp;in college, and is an infinitesimal fraction of the cost of a year&rsquo;s tuition at a private college. Yet I believe the results you could get from this 9 months of self-study and $300 will far surpass the career results you could achieve through a BA or MA program.&nbsp;With the right focus, these steps can guide you through the basics of getting started in just 9 months. Instead of birthing a baby, you are birthing a new life for yourself, of freedom, and prosperity.</p>
<h3 nodeIndex="242">Contest: Win 6 Months of Private, 1-on-1, Free Mentoring</h3>
<p nodeIndex="243">The thing that frustrates me about all the statistics around dropouts vs. graduates, is that they always compare people who stayed in college, to people who not only dropped out of school, but who also dropped out of <em nodeIndex="2229">learning</em>.</p>
<p nodeIndex="244">Take two cohorts of good, smart, motivated, ambitious 18-year-olds with similar intelligence, discipline, creativity, and work-ethic. Put one through a BA program, and one through the 9 months of self-study I&rsquo;ve outlined above. I believe the cohort of self-studiers&mdash;the kind of people I spent the last two years traveling across the country to find and interview&mdash;will kick the BA group&rsquo;s asses.</p>
<p nodeIndex="245">In the absence of means to conduct such a formalized study as above, I&rsquo;d like to propose my own little informal contest.</p>
<p nodeIndex="246"><strong nodeIndex="2230">I&rsquo;m going to give one reader a chance to have my own mentorship on these steps, free of charge, for six months.</strong></p>
<p nodeIndex="247">During this mentorship, you&rsquo;ll have two in-depth phone conversations with me per month, along with follow up emails in between. And, if it makes sense, I&rsquo;ll try to connect you with some amazing people in my network.</p>
<p nodeIndex="248">This contest is for any and all readers who were inspired by this article. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re young or old, if you&rsquo;re a high school dropout, are in school now, or a graduate of Harvard Law School. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;ve been unemployed for years, or are successfully employed now but wanting to switch careers.</p>
<p nodeIndex="249">The only rule for following this is: you must choose a field you have absolutely no work history, credential, or experience in. It must be a completely fresh field for you, starting from scratch.</p>
<p nodeIndex="250">If you don&rsquo;t have full time to devote to this, due to school or work obligations, and can only devote your off-hours to this, no problem! I&rsquo;ll take into account the whole picture of your life in choosing the winners. But no matter how much time you devote to it, the area you compete in must be completely new and fresh to you.</p>
<p nodeIndex="251"><strong nodeIndex="2231">Here&rsquo;s how to enter:</strong></p>
<ol nodeIndex="253"><li nodeIndex="252">Commit to yourself to follow the 9 steps above for the next 9 months</li>
<li nodeIndex="254">Create a blog exclusively dedicated to detailing your journey of self-education along these 9 steps (as per Step 2.) It must be a new blog, not one you already own.</li>
<li nodeIndex="255">On December 29, 2011 (three months from the date of this post), I want you to post a URL in the comments that links to a post on your blog detailing your progress. I will pick one person from these links to mentor for the remaining six months. I am looking for QUALITY of results achieved in three months, rather than speed of working through the steps. I would rather see someone get up to Steps 4 or 5 really really thoroughly in three months, than get to step 7 in a slipshod manner.</li>
</ol><p nodeIndex="256">There you have it. My curriculum for excelling in the informal job market. Go out and make it happen &#128578;</p>
<h3 nodeIndex="257">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p nodeIndex="258">You might think that college dropouts who become successful are &ldquo;outliers,&rdquo; and if you look at the statistics, that is true.</p>
<p nodeIndex="259">But that statistic is misleading, for a simple reason pointed out to me by my mentor <a href="http://www.victorcheng.com/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2232">Victor Cheng</a>:</p>
<p nodeIndex="260"><strong nodeIndex="2233">Most people who drop out of school also drop out of <em nodeIndex="2234">learning.</em></strong></p>
<p nodeIndex="261">If you drop out of <em nodeIndex="2235">learning</em>, you&rsquo;ll always be stuck in jobs that require little more than a pulse, such as mopping floors, or asking people about their desire for fries. That&rsquo;s why most dropouts are in dead-end jobs.</p>
<p nodeIndex="262">However, there are people who drop out of <em nodeIndex="2236">formal education</em>, while still maintaining an absolute passion and discipline for <em nodeIndex="2237">learning</em>&mdash;informally, non-institutionally, in the real world (and without the tuition bills or student loan payments). Those are the types of people I interviewed in my book, people like Eben and Jena. They dropped out of <em nodeIndex="2238">school</em>, but they never dropped out of <em nodeIndex="2239">learning</em>.</p>
<p nodeIndex="263">I spent the past two years interviewing the world&rsquo;s <em nodeIndex="2240">most</em> successful people who have the <em nodeIndex="2241">least</em> formal credentials for their success. <a href="http://amzn.to/pJ3WbK" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2242">I&rsquo;ve interviewed almost 40 millionaire and billionaires</a>, all self-made, and <em nodeIndex="2243">none</em> of them finished college. In interviewing them, I was consistently struck by one thing they all had in common: a complete lack of regard for socially-sanctioned formal &ldquo;requirements&rdquo; for bringing success into their lives.</p>
<p nodeIndex="264"><em nodeIndex="2244">No wonder they have so much success!</em></p>
<p nodeIndex="265">I&rsquo;ll leave you with a simple question: What barriers, check-boxes, and credentials do you believe in that are&nbsp;keeping you from the jobs, opportunity, and success you desire?</p>
<p nodeIndex="266">As you&rsquo;ve seen, nearly all of these barriers can be sidestepped, ignored, or hacked. It just takes some creativity and a few months of work.</p>
<p nodeIndex="267">What&rsquo;s holding you back?</p>
<h3 nodeIndex="268"><a name="footnotes" nodeIndex="2245"></a>Footnotes</h3>
<ol nodeIndex="270"><li nodeIndex="269">This approach works better in some fields than in others. I do not recommend trying to &ldquo;hack&rdquo; the requirement of a bar certification or a medical degree, if you want to practice law or medicine! This approach should not be used for fields that require state licensure, obviously. However, for non-licensed fields such as programming, design, PR, marketing, IT, entrepreneurship, solo-preneurship, self-employed consulting and service businesses, journalism, sales, non-profits, the arts, and for your average &ldquo;I need a decent job <em nodeIndex="2246">pronto!</em>&rdquo; type job searches, these approaches are golden. <a href="https://tim.blog/2011/09/29/8-steps-to-getting-what-you-want-without-formal-credentials/#citation1" nodeIndex="2247">Back to Text</a></li>
<li nodeIndex="271">There are some debates about exact numbers and percentages. After all, it&rsquo;s very hard to measure what&rsquo;s going on informally behind closed doors. However, virtually all career experts I&rsquo;ve seen quoted on the matter agree that vastly more jobs get filled <em nodeIndex="2248">informally</em> than get filled by people responding to job ads. As Steven Rothberg, founder of CollegeRecruiter.com, says on the MSNBC article, &ldquo;[a]bout 90 percent of job openings go unadvertised, yet about 90 percent of candidates apply only to advertised job openings.&rdquo; <a href="https://tim.blog/2011/09/29/8-steps-to-getting-what-you-want-without-formal-credentials/#citation2" nodeIndex="2249">Back to Text</a></li>
<li nodeIndex="272">Online social networking can be used to enhance/facilitate networking that is also happening offline, but it will never be a replacement. You can&rsquo;t status-update a handshake or a good look in the eyes, and you can&rsquo;t replace a two-hour dinner conversation with a tweet. <a href="https://tim.blog/2011/09/29/8-steps-to-getting-what-you-want-without-formal-credentials/#citation3" nodeIndex="2250">Back to Text</a></li>
