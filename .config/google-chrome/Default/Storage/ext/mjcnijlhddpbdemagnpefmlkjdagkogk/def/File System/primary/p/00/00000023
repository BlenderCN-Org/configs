<p nodeIndex="67">The following is a guest post by Breanden Beneschott, co-founder and COO of <a href="http://www.toptal.com/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="1967">Toptal</a>, a marketplace for top developers. I have no affiliation with the company, but I found Breanden&rsquo;s story fascinating.</p>
<p nodeIndex="68">This post covers how he traveled through 20+ countries while building a company, experiencing the best the world had to offer. His how-to instructions include&nbsp;travel tools, shortcuts, and all the non-obvious systems you&rsquo;d expect from a great engineer.</p>
<p nodeIndex="69">For context and to kick us off, an excerpt from Breanden&rsquo;s email to me might be helpful. Edited down a bit, here it is:</p>
<blockquote nodeIndex="70">
<p nodeIndex="71">We started Toptal 3.5 years ago from my dorm room at Princeton (I think a week after I met you briefly in Ed Zschau&rsquo;s class [TIM: I guest lectured there], where I decided to do my final paper on the company). By the time I finished school six months later, Toptal was doing well with clients and engineers all over the world. We decided to move to Eastern Europe and keep practicing what we were preaching, in terms of scaling a company via a completely distributed team. Doing so allowed us to funnel nearly all profits back into growing the business (and live like kings for next to nothing). We are now approx 60 team members and 1000 engineers (e.g., top-100 Rails contributors, guys from CERN, university professors, etc.) working with thousands of clients (e.g., Beats, Zendesk, Artsy, JPMorgan, etc.) with virtually zero restrictions when it comes to location.</p>
<p nodeIndex="72">People constantly ask me how I manage to travel and work the way I do. I had always hoped outside (non-Toptal) people would see this post and be inspired to <a href="http://www.toptal.com/developers" target="_blank" nodeIndex="1968">join us</a> or pick up and travel while working on their own big ideas.</p>
<p nodeIndex="73">BTW, I do expect that comments will highlight the ambiguity of the &ldquo;growing hundreds of percent year over year&rdquo; statement. We&rsquo;ve very deliberately avoided most press until now, as we didn&rsquo;t want to build a company based on PR, and we&rsquo;ve never publicly announced our revenue. Right now we are well north of XXM/yr [TIM: I replaced the actual number with XX but, suffice to say, they have 9-figure&nbsp;acquisition offers and term sheets]&nbsp;and growing like a weed, but few non-core people know that. So do you see any tactful way of preempting those sorts of comments?</p>
</blockquote>
<p nodeIndex="74">Yep, I do. I could include your email like I just did.</p>
<p nodeIndex="75">Now, on to the details. This is a good one, folks, so keep reading. &nbsp;Breanden&rsquo;s tips apply mostly to the mobility and travel pieces of the puzzle; if you&rsquo;d like additional business-building tools, I highly suggest <a href="https://fourhourworkweek.com/2011/09/24/how-to-create-a-million-dollar-business-this-weekend-examples-appsumo-mint-chihuahuas/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="1969">this article on rapid testing (in a weekend</a>), <a href="https://fourhourworkweek.com/2012/12/18/hacking-kickstarter-how-to-raise-100000-in-10-days-includes-successful-templates-e-mails-etc/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="1970">this article on hacking Kickstarter</a>, and <a href="https://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/02/04/how-to-get-published/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="1971">this post on all aspects of marketing and PR</a>.</p>

<p nodeIndex="78">I&rsquo;ve lived and worked remotely in approximately 29 countries&nbsp;since I finished school three years ago.

<p nodeIndex="81">I don&rsquo;t have an apartment. I don&rsquo;t have a house. I don&rsquo;t have an office.</p>
<p nodeIndex="82">I hate the cold, so I summer hop.</p>
<p nodeIndex="83">Everywhere I go, I meet great engineers who end up becoming invaluable&nbsp;parts&nbsp;of Toptal.</p>
<p nodeIndex="84">I encourage everyone in Toptal to travel, and <a title="The Global Toptal Community" href="http://www.toptal.com/community" target="_blank" nodeIndex="1973">a lot of us do</a>. Some of us travel for week long &ldquo;breaks&rdquo; throughout the year, and some of us live out of a suitcase like me. Few of us ever stop working for a full day.</p>
<h3 nodeIndex="85">I&rsquo;m writing this because&hellip;</h3>
<p nodeIndex="86">I was repeatedly asked if I had some sort of guide or checklist for&nbsp;traveling/working the way I do. Especially for first-timers, the idea of&nbsp;adventuring while working can be daunting. There are a lot of details to&nbsp;consider, and I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from my own trial-and-error.</p>
<p nodeIndex="87">The more I thought about it, the more I realized a guide like this was&nbsp;actually missing.</p>
<p nodeIndex="88">The <a title="Four Hour Work Week" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307465357/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307465357&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=offsitoftimfe-20" nodeIndex="1974">4-Hour Workweek</a> was great, and I like <a title="Tim Ferriss" href="https://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/" nodeIndex="1975">Tim Ferriss</a>&nbsp;a lot. But what if you want to work more than 4 hours a week? I like working crazy hours. I don&rsquo;t want a lifestyle company. I want to solve hard problems. I want to build something big and give it my all.</p>
<p nodeIndex="89">I want a book on how to create a billion-dollar company while becoming a fighter pilot. (I&rsquo;m trying to build a world-changing company while becoming a professional polo player.) That would be inspiring. But until it comes, maybe this post will be helpful to a few people.</p>
<h3 nodeIndex="90">Why travel?</h3>
<p nodeIndex="91"><strong nodeIndex="1976">Because it&rsquo;s unbelievably awesome. <br nodeIndex="1977"></strong>Now is the time: it&rsquo;s feasible like never before. You can put in a&nbsp;full work day no matter where you are. If you&rsquo;re standing in line&nbsp;for airport security, you can listen to <a title="The Changelog" href="http://thechangelog.com/" nodeIndex="1978">The&nbsp;Changelog</a>.&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re in the Hungarian countryside, you can work perfectly via&nbsp;4G. If you&rsquo;re flying across the world, you can work from the moment&nbsp;you buckle in to the moment you stand up to get off the plane. The&nbsp;airport will have WiFi to push a commit if your plane didn&rsquo;t. You&nbsp;can travel while producing some of the best work of your career, and&nbsp;you will grow with every new stamp in your passport.</p>
<p nodeIndex="92"><strong nodeIndex="1979">The secret benefit: avoiding burnout. <br nodeIndex="1980"></strong>I don&rsquo;t take vacations. I don&rsquo;t want to work hard to build a company&nbsp;that makes lots of money so I can piss off and go on holiday. I&rsquo;m at a start-up. I&rsquo;m a part of it, and it&rsquo;s a part of me. This is a marathon, and there will be a winner. Traveling and working allows you to go non-stop. There is no burnout.&nbsp;There&rsquo;s no staring at a clock or calendar waiting for the EOD/weekend/break. You&rsquo;re refreshed weekly, and you can hone your focus and structure your time so you are a cross functional superstar who never stops&nbsp;learning.</p>

</div>
<h3 nodeIndex="95">Length of travel</h3>
<p nodeIndex="96">I usually stay in places for <strong nodeIndex="1981">~3 months</strong>. Why?</p>
<p nodeIndex="97"><strong nodeIndex="1982">It fits under the constraints of the typical tourist visa. <br nodeIndex="1983"></strong>More on that in a second.</p>
<p nodeIndex="98"><strong nodeIndex="1984">It gives you time to relax and focus in between the stressful travel sessions. <br nodeIndex="1985"></strong>Power trips of 9 countries in 3 weeks are for students on holiday. You need to be able to stop traveling and focus on work.</p>
<p nodeIndex="99"><strong nodeIndex="1986">It gives you time to really explore and get to know a place and people. <br nodeIndex="1987"></strong>There are almost certainly local tech meetups, and there are likely to be <a title="Other Toptal Engineers and Events" href="http://www.toptal.com/events" nodeIndex="1988">other Toptal engineers</a> wherever you go now as well.</p>
<p nodeIndex="100"><strong nodeIndex="1989">You can really try local culture. <br nodeIndex="1990"></strong>Learn to play polo in Argentina. Practice capoeira in Brazil. Go to trance festivals in Europe. If you don&rsquo;t know where to start, join <a title="Internations" href="http://www.internations.org/home/" nodeIndex="1991">Internations</a> and go to expat meetups.</p>
<p nodeIndex="101"><strong nodeIndex="1992">It helps with costs. <br nodeIndex="1993"></strong>Trips of this duration help you negotiate special medium-term deals on apartments, cars, vespas, etc.</p>
<h3 nodeIndex="102">Who to go with</h3>
<p nodeIndex="103"><strong nodeIndex="1994">A close friend/colleague <br nodeIndex="1995"></strong>You can split costs for a lot of things like cars, hotels, etc. You can also split the research and push each other to do things you might not do yourself (like go out to new places, go on adventures, rent a boat, etc.).</p>
<p nodeIndex="104"><strong nodeIndex="1996">Alone <br nodeIndex="1997"></strong>Not for the faint of heart, but not everyone has the flexibility you do as a software engineer. If you don&rsquo;t have anyone to go with, don&rsquo;t let it stop you. With Internations and a network like Toptal, you can almost certainly go anywhere and immediately find people with lots in common.</p>
<p nodeIndex="105"><strong nodeIndex="1998">A girlfriend/boyfriend <br nodeIndex="1999"></strong>Can be by far the most expensive option, but it&rsquo;s probably the most rewarding and fun. Nothing brings compatible people together like adventure. However, nothing drives incompatible people apart like stress, so be careful. The other thing to consider is whether your significant other will also be working during your travels. If so, that&rsquo;s tremendous, and you are very lucky. If not, that can be very hard. The added costs of having a dependent aside, you don&rsquo;t want to be in a position where someone resents you for constantly working during what they&rsquo;ve misunderstood to be a vacation. Luckily there are many interesting careers in addition to software engineering that are now doable remotely (e.g., executive assistant, translator, designer, tutor, entrepreneur, etc.).</p>
<h3 nodeIndex="106">What to take</h3>
<p nodeIndex="107"><strong nodeIndex="2000">Backpack</strong></p>
<p nodeIndex="108">Always a carry on. Pretty much always with me.</p>
<p nodeIndex="109"><strong nodeIndex="2001">Laptop <br nodeIndex="2002"></strong>I use a <a title='MacBook Pro 15"' href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2003">MacBook Pro 15&Prime; Retina</a>.</p>

Don&rsquo;t leave the store until you have the phone in your hands with working Internet. If you&rsquo;re on an iPhone 5, you can almost always <a title="Cutting a micro SIM to nano" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6T1Mygucak" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2007">cut a micro SIM to fit the nano</a> SIM and it will work just fine.</p>
<p nodeIndex="111"><strong nodeIndex="2008">Tablet <br nodeIndex="2009"></strong>You&rsquo;re an engineer. Use <a title="Airdisplay" href="http://www.avatron.com/apps/air-display/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2010">Airdisplay</a> to enable your tablet as a second monitor. It also makes it much easier to work on planes: I used an <a title="iPad Mini" href="http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2011">iPad Mini</a> to write this post on a flight from LAX to Auckland, New Zealand.</p>

<p nodeIndex="132"><strong nodeIndex="2055">Clothes. You can figure out the basics but I usually carry the following:</strong></p>
<ul nodeIndex="134"><li nodeIndex="133">Dress shirt</li>
<li nodeIndex="135">Dress shoes</li>
<li nodeIndex="136">Gym shorts</li>

<p nodeIndex="149"><strong nodeIndex="2057">Snowboards, polo equipment, surf boards, or whatever you need for your specific trip. <br nodeIndex="2058"></strong>It sounds strange, but always make sure your stuff is clean. Some countries (like New Zealand) are very protective, and if there&rsquo;s dirt, sand, grass, hair, etc. on your stuff, they may take everything and sanitize it for you (in God knows what) at the airport, or even confiscate it.</p>
<h3 nodeIndex="150">Where to stay</h3>
<p nodeIndex="151"><strong nodeIndex="2059">Try <a title="NomadList" href="http://nomadlist.io/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2060">NomadList</a> for selecting a city.</strong> <br nodeIndex="2061">
The data here does not match my own experience in many cases, but, overall, it gives a pretty good overview of some of the important aspects you&rsquo;ll want to consider for each location you choose.</p>
<p nodeIndex="152"><strong nodeIndex="2062"><a title="Airbnb" href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2063">Airbnb</a> is what I use most, but it&rsquo;s a PITA [pain in the ass] for medium-term stays. <br nodeIndex="2064"></strong>I see a need in the market for medium-term rentals. If you know of a better solution, please let me know! Unless you&rsquo;re booking far in advance (something I find impossible), you&rsquo;ll find Airbnb places might be available for a month straight except for one or two weekends where you&rsquo;ll have to either temporarily move out or find another place. Don&rsquo;t get too comfortable. I&rsquo;ve had success asking the Airbnb hosts if they have recommendations on medium-term housing. They often have friends with unlisted places or can make special arrangements for you (like getting an apartment ready that they weren&rsquo;t renting at all before&hellip; and since you&rsquo;re there, you can check it out before you commit). Once you&rsquo;ve stayed with them via Airbnb, you&rsquo;ve earned their trust a bit, and they&rsquo;re usually very helpful.</p>
<p nodeIndex="153"><strong nodeIndex="2065">You need great Internet. <br nodeIndex="2066"></strong>So, for now, Antarctica is out. But most places are totally fine (and often better than in the US). However, you have to do your homework. As a traveling software engineer, you can never be unavailable due to bad Internet. Buy a pay-as-you-go SIM first thing, but still be sure to explicitly ask every host/hotel/realtor etc. what the <a title="Internet Speed Test" href="http://www.speedtest.net/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2067">Internet speeds are</a>.</p>
<p nodeIndex="154">Here&rsquo;s my standard message when making an inquiry on Airbnb:</p>
<blockquote nodeIndex="155">
<p nodeIndex="156">Hi {{name}},</p>
<p nodeIndex="157">Your apartment looks amazing. Any chance it&rsquo;s available tonight for&nbsp;two people?</p>
<p nodeIndex="158">Also, as engineers, we do a lot of our work online, so we really&nbsp;need stable and quick internet. Do you know the speed of your&nbsp;connection (e.g., 10Mbs/2Mbps)? If not, would you mind running a&nbsp;little test (just google &ldquo;internet speed test&rdquo; and click the first&nbsp;result) and letting me know?</p>
<p nodeIndex="159">Thank you so much for your consideration.</p>
<p nodeIndex="160">Best, <br nodeIndex="2068">
Breanden</p>
</blockquote>
<p nodeIndex="161">Every hotel will say their Internet is great, but you can usually find reviews about how good their Internet really&nbsp;is on <a title="Tripadvisor" href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2069">Tripadvisor</a> (and by Googling). Sometimes specific rooms at a hotel are ok while others are not. Do not get into a position where you can&rsquo;t have a clear Skype call because you listened to a clueless receptionist.</p>
<p nodeIndex="162"><strong nodeIndex="2070">You can also try <a title="All The Rooms" href="http://alltherooms.com/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2071">All The Rooms</a>&nbsp;and <a title="HomeAway" href="http://www.homeaway.com/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2072">HomeAway</a>. <br nodeIndex="2073"></strong>All The Rooms&nbsp;is an aggregator of many house/apartment/hotel websites. HomeAway is similar to Airbnb.&nbsp;Some of these sites are better than others in each city.</p>
<p nodeIndex="163"><strong nodeIndex="2074"><a title="Kayak" href="http://www.kayak.com/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2075">Kayak</a>&nbsp;and <a title="Hipmunk" href="http://www.hipmunk.com/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2076">Hipmunk</a> are good for hotels/rental cars. <br nodeIndex="2077"></strong>However, you can usually call the hotels directly and negotiate better rates and upgrades.</p>
<p nodeIndex="164"><strong nodeIndex="2078">Always ask for a better room or free upgrade when you check into a hotel.</strong> <br nodeIndex="2079">
You&rsquo;ll get something about 50% of the time.</p>
<p nodeIndex="165"><strong nodeIndex="2080">Similarly, always try to negotiate a special weekly or monthly rate on housing and cars.</strong></p>
<p nodeIndex="166"><strong nodeIndex="2081">Don&rsquo;t stay in hostels. <br nodeIndex="2082"></strong>You&rsquo;re not a kid. You&rsquo;re a professional, and you need dedicated time to focus on work.</p>
<h3 nodeIndex="167">How to pull it off</h3>
<p nodeIndex="168"><strong nodeIndex="2083">The longer you wait, the more expensive it is. <br nodeIndex="2084"></strong>That said, I hate planning, and I find that last minute usually works out fine. Worst case scenario: you&rsquo;re uncomfortable for a little while (red eye flight, stuck in traffic while it&rsquo;s 900 degrees, etc.) but you end up with a funny story and an adventure.</p>
<p nodeIndex="169"><strong nodeIndex="2085">Rental cars (above) <br nodeIndex="2086"></strong>If you&rsquo;re American, learn how to drive a stick shift before&nbsp;you go overseas. They are much cheaper to rent, and it&rsquo;s often impossible to find an automatic.</p>
<p nodeIndex="170"><strong nodeIndex="2087">Rewards programs <br nodeIndex="2088"></strong>Use <a title="TripIt" href="https://www.tripit.com/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2089">TripIt</a> or <a title="SuperFly" href="https://www.superfly.com/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2090">SuperFly</a> to keep track of and redeem your rewards. They will build up over time.</p>
<p nodeIndex="171"><strong nodeIndex="2091">Money <br nodeIndex="2092"></strong>I always try to carry a few hundred USD. It&rsquo;s easily exchanged whereas others currencies aren&rsquo;t always. Before you travel, you&rsquo;ll also need to call your banks and let them know in which countries you&rsquo;ll be using your debit card. Otherwise they may block it after your first transaction, and you&rsquo;ll have a mess to untangle. Also, be sure to download a currency converter app so you know how much things cost; and when you need more cash, pull it from an ATM instead of an exchange in order to reduce fees.</p>
<p nodeIndex="172"><strong nodeIndex="2093">Skype number <br nodeIndex="2094"></strong>Get one and add credit to it so you can call clients, hotels, etc. any time. It&rsquo;s also wise to have it forward to your current mobile number so your clients and colleagues can call you when they need to.</p>
<p nodeIndex="173"><strong nodeIndex="2095">Lost&nbsp;a charger or adapter? <br nodeIndex="2096"></strong>Ask the hotel desk. They usually have a box of them that other guests have left behind.</p>
<p nodeIndex="174"><strong nodeIndex="2097">WiFi <br nodeIndex="2098"></strong>Check <a title="Foursquare" href="https://foursquare.com/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2099">Foursquare</a> for free WiFi hotspots. Rewards lounges usually have a WiFi network. Restaurants often do as well&hellip; just ask for the password. Many gas stations like Shell and OMV have open and fast WiFi as well.</p>
<p nodeIndex="175"><strong nodeIndex="2100">Time zones <br nodeIndex="2101"></strong>Always use something like <a title="World Time Buddy" href="http://www.worldtimebuddy.com/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2102">World Time Buddy</a> to easily double check time zones. Do not get into a position where you&rsquo;re missing team calls because you forgot daylight savings time or you did the mental math wrong.</p>
<h3 nodeIndex="176">When to go</h3>
<p nodeIndex="177">Any time you want.</p>
<h3 nodeIndex="178">Visas</h3>
<p nodeIndex="179">As I mentioned earlier, most countries permit a three-month stay under their tourist visa. (Specifically, 90 out of every 180 days.)</p>
<p nodeIndex="180"><strong nodeIndex="2103">Most counties are very easy to go in and out of. <br nodeIndex="2104"></strong>The worst is always the US where I&rsquo;m treated like a terrorist virtually every time I enter or leave. (I refuse to fly into Seattle&ndash;Tacoma International Airport ever again). For many countries (in my experience, as an American), all you need to do is show up at the border not looking like a criminal, and they will give you a tourist visa as you go through the airport. In some countries like Turkey, you&rsquo;ll have to pay a small fee (~$20). In others, you need to fill out paperwork beforehand and pay a larger fee (e.g., Argentina and Brazil). I carry a printout of a recent bank statement and copies of my return tickets (if I have them) just in case a customs agent asks to see them (and some countries like New Zealand require them).</p>
<p nodeIndex="181"><strong nodeIndex="2105">Always check visa requirements before&nbsp;you travel. <br nodeIndex="2106"></strong>I like using <a title="Check Visa Requirements" href="http://www.cheapoair.com/travel/visapassport.asp" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2107">CheapoAir&rsquo;s tool</a>. If you have questions, call an embassy.</p>
<p nodeIndex="182"><strong nodeIndex="2108">This sounds obvious, but don&rsquo;t overstay your visas. <br nodeIndex="2109"></strong>While most countries are pretty forgiving (you pay a fee on your way out/in and you can&rsquo;t come back for a while&hellip; if you&rsquo;re caught at all), it&rsquo;s not worth the stress (and waiting in that line feeling guilty and terrified is freaking stressful). If you love a place and want to stay longer, find a recommended lawyer on <a title="Internations" href="http://www.internations.org/home/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2110">Internations</a> (just post a question asking for recommendations) and ask what it takes. For Europe, it&rsquo;s pretty easy (at least in my experience as an American). You can go to a lax country like Hungary and pretty easily get a 1-year visa, which is then good for anywhere in the <a title="Schengen Zone" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2111">Schengen Zone</a>.</p>
<h3 nodeIndex="183">Misc.</h3>
<p nodeIndex="184"><strong nodeIndex="2112">Communication with clients.</strong></p>
<p nodeIndex="185">If the technical ability is there, then now it comes down to communication and reliability. I always tell engineers and their clients that if I were to take each into a separate room, they need to always be able to give identical answers to the following three questions:</p>
<ol nodeIndex="187"><li nodeIndex="186">What are you working on now?</li>
<li nodeIndex="188">What were you just working on?</li>
<li nodeIndex="189">What will you be working on tomorrow?</li>
</ol><p nodeIndex="190">Maintaining that level of communication and transparency is not difficult in an office, but it&rsquo;s also not difficult when you&rsquo;re remote. Always be connected and proactive.</p>
<p nodeIndex="191"><strong nodeIndex="2113">Always lock your suitcases with <a title="TSA Approved Locks" href="http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/baggage-locks" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2114">TSA approved locks</a>. <br nodeIndex="2115"></strong>I&rsquo;ve had lots of baggage get lost and several misc items get stolen.</p>
<p nodeIndex="192"><strong nodeIndex="2116">When flying, always check the rates for business class. <br nodeIndex="2117"></strong>If you&rsquo;re checking multiple bags, sometimes business class can be cheaper because the bags are free.</p>
<p nodeIndex="193"><strong nodeIndex="2118">When you&rsquo;re on long flights, get up and walk around every couple hours. <br nodeIndex="2119"></strong>You don&rsquo;t want to <a title="Blood Clots on Long Flights" href="http://www.hematology.org/Patients/Clots/Travel.aspx" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2120">die from a blood clot.</a></p>
<h3 nodeIndex="194">Attitude</h3>
<p nodeIndex="195"><strong nodeIndex="2121">Shit will happen. Try to let it go immediately. <br nodeIndex="2122"></strong>You don&rsquo;t need to (nor can you) plan every last detail when you travel, and you don&rsquo;t need to follow every rule. Sometimes you need to wing it. Be impulsive. Seize an opportunity to jump on a train to Oktoberfest with a group of brand new friends. Invite the girl you can&rsquo;t stop thinking about to a wild weekend in Turkey. Go to Georgia and party like Russia might come back tomorrow.</p>
<p nodeIndex="196">That&rsquo;s when awesome happens. Welcome to <a href="http://www.toptal.com/" target="_blank" nodeIndex="2123">Toptal</a>.</p>
