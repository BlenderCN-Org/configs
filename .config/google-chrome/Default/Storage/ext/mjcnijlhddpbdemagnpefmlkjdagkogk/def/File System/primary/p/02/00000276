Actually, it was even more specialized that that. The collector, a curious character named Jamie Ross, liked to collect Navajo rugs with English words, letters, or language woven into the designs.</p><p name="17ff" id="17ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="58">I was intrigued by some of the designs so I asked him about the history of some of the pieces. Jamie is the kind of guy who turns a quick ten second question into a slow ten minute answer. That was fine by me, I had nowhere else to be.</p><p name="60a4" id="60a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="59">He explained a lot of things. He talked about his fascination with letters and words and why he especially liked them when they showed up on Navajo rugs. He also talked a bit about crazy quilts, another one of his obsessions.</p><p name="5b50" id="5b50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="60">But there was one thing he said that really stuck with me. I asked him why a lot of the rugs seemed to have mistakes woven into the patterns. Obvious distortions in the patterns, stray lines, or a shape that was just a bit off compared to the other shapes in the piece.</p><p name="f16e" id="f16e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="61">He said there are many explanations. One popular one is that the Navajo intentionally weave mistakes into their rugs to remind them that man isn&rsquo;t perfect. That sensibility can also be found in the Wabi-sabi art of Japan.</p><p name="0a94" id="0a94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="62">But he preferred another explanation. He said the mistakes weren&rsquo;t intentional. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em" nodeIndex="170">What was intentional was the desire not to go back and fix them.</em></p><p name="4a03" id="4a03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="63">He said the Navajo saw mistakes as moments in time. And since you can&rsquo;t change time, why try to change a mistake that already happened? The mistake is already woven into the fabric of time. It&rsquo;s good to be reminded of it when you look back.</p><p name="d5f4" id="d5f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="64">Further, he compared it to climbing a mountain. If you climb a mountain you are sure to have a few missteps along the way. But you keep going. You don&rsquo;t stop and start over if you trip here or take the wrong path there. You keep going. You can&rsquo;t remove that step. It happened, it&rsquo;s part of the climb. And when the climb is done, you&rsquo;ve finished. As long as you made it to the top, you don&rsquo;t call the climb a mistake. Likewise, the Navajo don&rsquo;t call a rug with some off stiches a mistake. If the rug is finished, it&rsquo;s a successful rug. More importantly, a rug with a few off stitches is an honest rug.</p><p name="29bb" id="29bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="65">Now, I don&rsquo;t know if this is Jamie&rsquo;s own personal interpretation, or something other&rsquo;s Navajo scholars (or Navajo themselves) can back up, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter to me. I love the idea regardless.</p></div></div></section></div></div>
