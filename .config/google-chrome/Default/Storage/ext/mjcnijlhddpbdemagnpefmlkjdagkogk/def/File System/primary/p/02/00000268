As outlined in The Freelance Manifesto:</h3>
<ul nodeIndex="103"><li nodeIndex="102"><em nodeIndex="162"><strong nodeIndex="163">$350/day</strong></em> - New to freelancing, just got out of college, or not as confident in your abilities. This is not too much where it&rsquo;s a risk for the client, but enough so the client doesn't question your abilities.</li>
<li nodeIndex="104"><em nodeIndex="164"><strong nodeIndex="165">$500/day</strong></em> - You are confident, have a decent reel, and have a couple years under your belt (this was Joey&rsquo;s rate when he started freelancing).</li>
<li nodeIndex="105"><em nodeIndex="166"><strong nodeIndex="167">$650/day</strong></em> - Have many years of experience, multidisciplinary, can do 3D and 2D, can mix, edit, do some sound fx, etc. Are more than a order taker. You contribute to the overall creative for the project. Clients can tell if you are worth that amount, so you need to make sure you have the experience and the expertise to back it up.</li>
<li nodeIndex="106"><em nodeIndex="168"><strong nodeIndex="169">$750/day</strong></em> - Your work has appeared on sites like Motionographer. You have a reputation of needing minimal hand holding. You take away as much work as possible from the client, make them look good, and come up with ideas that they wouldn&rsquo;t have thought of if they didn&rsquo;t hire you.</li>
<li nodeIndex="107"><em nodeIndex="170"><strong nodeIndex="171">$800-1000/day</strong></em> - You can run your own studio, and have experience subcontracting work out, have connections, and can handle large projects. You might be directing a piece or a team of motion designers.</li>
<li nodeIndex="108"><em nodeIndex="172"><strong nodeIndex="173">$1,500/day</strong></em> - You are a specialist. Few can do what you can do, at the level you can do it, with the speed and efficiency you can do it with. Realflow, Houdini, particle, fire, water simulations, etc.</li>
<li nodeIndex="109"><em nodeIndex="174"><strong nodeIndex="175">$2,000+/day</strong></em> - You are a select few that have been in the industry 10+ years, have worked with some of the largest clients in some of the largest studios, where you might be hired to oversee a project from start to finish. You might have to roll up your sleeves and do some motion design, but that's not what they are paying you for. They are paying you for direction, creative ideas, and thinking of out-of-the box solutions that really stand out, all the while knowing how to execute with a team.</li>
