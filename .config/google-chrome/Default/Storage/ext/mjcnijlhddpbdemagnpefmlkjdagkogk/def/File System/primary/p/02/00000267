<h3 nodeIndex="120">4. Social Media</h3>
<p nodeIndex="121">You hope I&rsquo;m kidding right? If you have been shying away from social media, now is the time to cut it out and get posting. I'm not talking about pictures of latte art on Facebook. Start posting your work on <a href="https://dribbble.com/" target="_blank" title="https://dribbble.com/" nodeIndex="169">Dribbble</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/" target="_blank" title="https://www.instagram.com/" nodeIndex="170">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.behance.net/" target="_blank" title="https://www.behance.net/" nodeIndex="171">Behance</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/" nodeIndex="172">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p nodeIndex="122">People spend more time on Social Media than actually talking to others, so if you want to reach more people get on at least one social channel. In the social media world, keep it professional. Start an account that is solely for your work. Post great work as often as you make it. People will see it and who knows, maybe even hire you to make more of it.</p>
<p nodeIndex="123">And for the love of all things MoGraph please keep the political posts on your private Facebook account. I've heard of multiple Motion Designers losing out on work because of controversial political posts.</p>
