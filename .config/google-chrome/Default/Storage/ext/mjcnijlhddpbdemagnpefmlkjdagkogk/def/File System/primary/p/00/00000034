<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="9">I get emails all the time from people who are struggling with very common difficulties:</p>
<ul class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="11"><li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="10">Wanting to overcome anger</li>
<li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="12">Wanting to deal more calmly with stress</li>
<li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="13">Hurt by other people&rsquo;s inconsiderate actions</li>
<li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="14">Getting stuck in resentment and thinking about how others have wronged you</li>
<li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="15">Struggling with change because it&rsquo;s hard</li>
<li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="16">Struggling with letting go of clutter because of various emotional attachments</li>
<li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="17">Finding all kinds of obstacles to taking on a project, side hustle, new business, writing a book/blog, etc.</li>
</ul><p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="18">And I completely understand these difficulties, because I struggle with them too. Here&rsquo;s the thing &mdash; there are just two things stopping us from being present or taking the action we want to take:</p>
<ol class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="20"><li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="19">The stories we have in our heads about other people, what&rsquo;s happening, and ourselves</li>
<li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="21">Our habitual pattern of staying in those stories instead of being present or taking action</li>
</ol><p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="22">It&rsquo;s really one thing: our mental habit of staying stuck in the stories in our heads.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="23">When I say &ldquo;stories,&rdquo; this isn&rsquo;t a judgment about whether what we&rsquo;re saying in our heads is true or not. It&rsquo;s just what our minds do &mdash; they make up a narrative about the world, including other people and ourselves. Our minds are narrative machines. You could see the narrative as true or not, but that&rsquo;s not the point &mdash; the narrative is getting in the way of being present and taking action.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="24">What kind of stories do I mean? I mean things that we make up and spin around in our heads (true or not):</p>
<ul class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="26"><li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="25">They shouldn&rsquo;t act that way</li>
<li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="27">If they loved me they wouldn&rsquo;t be so inconsiderate</li>
<li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="28">This is too hard, I don&rsquo;t want to do this</li>
<li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="29">I suck, I keep failing, I am inadequate</li>
<li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="30">They keep doing this, I don&rsquo;t know why they keep doing that to me</li>
<li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="31">They hurt me, they are not a good person</li>
<li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="32">I can&rsquo;t start my business/blog/project until I learn this, or get to this place in my life, or have perfect peace in my day and am in a good mood</li>
<li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="33">This shouldn&rsquo;t be happening to me! This sucks!</li>
</ul><p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="34">These stories have some truth to them, which is why we cling to them so much. But these stories block us from being present. They are not helpful.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="35">What would it be like if we <a href="https://zenhabits.net/nothing/" nodeIndex="81">didn&rsquo;t cling to them</a> so much? What if we could develop a mind that clings to nothing?</p>
<h3 nodeIndex="36">Dropping the Stories &amp; Becoming Present</h3>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="37">We can&rsquo;t stop the mind from coming up with the stories, as it is a narrative machine. However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean we have to cling to the stories and keep them spinning around in our heads.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="38">Notice when you&rsquo;re stuck in a story. Hint: if you&rsquo;re angry, stressed, frustrated, disappointed, feeling shame or fear, dreaming about the future, thinking about something that happened &hellip; you&rsquo;re stuck in a story.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="39">Notice that the story is causing you to be stressed, angry, afraid, whatever. Notice that you are spinning it around in your head, and it is occupying your attention.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="40">Now see if you can drop out of the story and into the present moment. Become curious: What is happening right now, in front of you? What sensations can you notice in your body? What is the light like? What sounds can you notice?</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="41">When you go back to your story (you will), try coming back to the present moment. Stay longer. Come back gently, without judgment.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="42">What can you appreciate in this moment? A feeling of <a href="https://zenhabits.net/divine/" nodeIndex="82">appreciating the sacredness of this moment</a> can counteract the story, and change your way of being.</p>
<h3 nodeIndex="43">Dealing with Stress &amp; Anger Without the Story</h3>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="44">Stress and anger can be difficult things, because we have such a hard time letting them go.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="45">But what if you could drop out of the stories that are causing the stress and anger (or frustration, resentment, complaining) and just be present with whatever you&rsquo;re feeling?</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="46">Drop into your body and notice what sensations are there.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="47">If you have difficult sensations in your body, see if you can be curious about them and stay with them, rather than spinning around a story about them. Stay with them longer (they might be located in your chest area), as you would try to stay with the sensations of your breath during a breath meditation.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="48">Again, when your mind wanders back to the story, just come back gently. Stay with the sensations. Be present with them.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="49">Touching the sensations in your body, of stress or anger, is a way to transform yourself. It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily get rid of the feelings &mdash; but it changes your relationship to them. You no longer need to get rid of them, because you are fine just being with them. You develop a trust that you can stay present with them, without running or hiding or needing to <em nodeIndex="83">do</em> anything about them.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="50">Each time you get stressed, each time you feel anger or frustration or resentment &hellip; this is an opportunity to practice and develop trust in yourself. Every spike of fear or stress is an opportunity to transform, to open, to stay and be present.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="51">In this way, every stress is making you more mindful, less attached, and more open to life.</p>
<h3 nodeIndex="52">Taking Action Without the Story</h3>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="53">The stories in our heads also stop us from taking the action we want to take in our lives &mdash; from changing habits to eating better to getting rid of clutter to tackling that difficult project.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="54">Some examples:</p>
<ul class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="56"><li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="55">I don&rsquo;t feel like exercising, I feel lazy, it&rsquo;s too hard</li>
<li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="57">I don&rsquo;t know how to tackle this big project, it&rsquo;s too complicated</li>
<li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="58">I don&rsquo;t know how to blog, there is so much I don&rsquo;t know, I have to learn it all before I can start</li>
<li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="59">There&rsquo;s too much clutter, and I don&rsquo;t know what to do with it all, I can&rsquo;t tackle all of that</li>
<li class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="60">Maybe I should do something else, I don&rsquo;t really like this kind of work, I think I would be better trying one of the other options I like</li>
</ul><p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="61">There is some truth to each of the stories, but the fact is, they are getting in the way of action. They aren&rsquo;t helpful.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="62">What would happen if we just dropped the stories and took action, staying in the present as we did so?</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="63">Imagine dropping into your body when you have a story about why you shouldn&rsquo;t exercise &hellip; and getting present. Then putting on your workout clothes and shoes, staying present without the story. Then doing some pushups or starting to run.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="64">You don&rsquo;t need the story to take action. Drop into the present, and just act. Stay present as you act. Be curious about what it&rsquo;s like, rather than thinking you know what it will be like ahead of time. Take a &ldquo;don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; mindset, and find out!</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="65">Don&rsquo;t have any clarity about a project? Start doing it, and clarity will come as you discover what it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="66">Afraid you&rsquo;re not good enough to do the project? Only one way to truly know &mdash; take action on it and see!</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="67">Feeling overwhelmed because there&rsquo;s too much clutter to tackle? Declutter one thing. Take action on one spot on your counter. There&rsquo;s no need for the story about it being too much.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="68">The truth is, even if we can&rsquo;t avoid generating these stories, we don&rsquo;t have to get stuck in them, especially if they are unhelpful. Sometimes it&rsquo;s good to have a narrative that helps us plan and figure things out, but often it&rsquo;s better just to find out by being present and taking action.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeIndex="69">And you can do that very simply: just drop into the sensations of your body and surroundings. Notice. Get curious. Stay. Come back gently. Appreciate the sacredness of this moment.</p>
